#### About Me

I am Hongkuan Zhou, and I obtained my bachelor's and master's degree from the Technical University of Munich, specialising in Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a keen interest in areas such as Robotic Manipulation and Perception, End-to-End Autonomous Driving Technologies, Neuro-symbolic AI, and Knowledge Graph Embeddings.
#### Research Interests

- **Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning**: Robotic Arm Manipulation with Reinforcement Learning or Imitation Learning Algorithms
- **End-to-End Autonomous Driving**: Multi-sensors Fusion Technology and Control Strategies
- **Neural-symbolic AI**: Neuro-symbolic AI combines symbolic representations and reasoning with neural network-based learning and pattern recognition capabilities

#### Education
- Bosch Cooperative Research/University of Stuttgart (Octorber 2023 - Now). Ph.D. Student with the topic of Machine Learning & Knowledge Graph. 
- Technical University of Munich (Apr 2021 - Apr 2023). M.S in Computer Science.
- Technical University of Munich (Oct 2018 – Apr 2021). B.S. in Computer Science.
- Karlsruher Institut für Technologie  (Oct 2017 – Oct 2018). MINT-Kolleg
